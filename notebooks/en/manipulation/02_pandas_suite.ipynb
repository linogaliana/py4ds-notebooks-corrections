    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [introductory chapter to `Pandas`](../../content/manipulation/02_pandas_intro.qmd) presented the concept of data organized in the form of a *DataFrame* and the practicality of the `Pandas` ecosystem for performing simple operations on a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is rare to work exclusively on a raw source. A dataset generally gains value when compared to other sources. For researchers, this allows contextualizing the information present in one source by comparing or associating it with other sources. For data scientists in the private sector, it often involves linking information about the same person in multiple customer databases or comparing customers with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of modern data science tools, especially `Pandas`, is the ease with which they allow restructuring sources to work on multiple datasets in a project. This chapter consolidates the principles previously seen by refining the data processing. It will mainly explore two types of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Group descriptive statistics;\n",
    "-   Data merging by common characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing this work simply, reliably, and efficiently is essential for data scientists as this task is common. Fortunately, `Pandas` handles this very well with structured data. In the following chapters, and also throughout the [section on text data processing](../../content/nlp/index.qmd), we will see how to handle less structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this work, we will deepen our understanding of a real world phenomenon through detailed descriptive statistics. This is an essential step before moving on to [inferential statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference), the approach that consists of formalizing and generalizing correlations or causal relationships between observed characteristics and a phenomenon.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we saw how to obtain an aggregated statistic easily with `Pandas`. However, it is common to have data with intermediate analysis strata that are relevant: geographical variables, membership in socio-demographic groups related to recorded characteristics, temporal period indicators, etc. To better understand the structure of the data, data scientists are often led to construct descriptive statistics on sub-groups present in the data. For example, we previously constructed emission statistics at the national level. But what about the emission profiles of different departments? To answer this question, it will be useful to aggregate our data at the departmental level. This will give us different information from the initial dataset (municipal level) and the most aggregated level (national level).\n",
    "\n",
    "In `SQL`, it is very simple to segment data to perform operations on coherent blocks and recollect results in the appropriate dimension. The underlying logic is that of *split-apply-combine*, which is adopted by data manipulation languages, including `pandas` [which is no exception](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image, from [this site](https://unlhcc.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/16-plyr/), well represents how the `split`-`apply`-`combine` approach works:\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Pandas`, we use `groupby` to segment the data according to one or more axes (this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/pandas-groupby/) on the subject is particularly useful). All the aggregation operations (counting, averages, etc.) that we saw earlier can be applied by group.\n",
    "\n",

For example, in business databases, customer information (address, age, etc.) will be in one file, sales in another, and product characteristics in a third file. To have a complete base that compares all this information, it will be necessary to join these three files based on common information.\n",

    "### 5.3.2 Sirene: the identifier in business data\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect French business microdata, there is a unique identification number: the [Siren number](https://entreprendre.service-public.fr/vosdroits/F32135). It is an identification number in a legal business directory essential for all legal, fiscal, and other procedures. For companies that have multiple establishments—for example, in several cities—there is a derived identifier called the [Siret](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/cedef/numero-siret): the 9 digits of the Siren number are followed by 5 establishment identification digits. Moreover, public administrations are also concerned with the Siren number: being involved in market operations (purchasing equipment, renting goods, etc.), they also have a Siren identifier. As they are registered in legal directories whose information is public, the Siren numbers and the associated company names are available in open data, for example, on [annuaire-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/](https://annuaire-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/) for occasional searches, or on [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/base-sirene-des-entreprises-et-de-leurs-etablissements-siren-siret/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This Sirene database is a treasure trove of information, sometimes amusing, about French companies. For example, the site [tif.hair/](https://tif.hair/) cataloged the proportion of hair salons with puns in their names. When an entrepreneur declares the creation of a business, they receive a Siren number and an activity code (the [APE code](https://entreprendre.service-public.fr/vosdroits/F33050)) related to the description of their business activity. This code allows the classification of a business activity in the [French Classification of Activities (NAF)](https://www.insee.fr/fr/information/2406147), which will be used by Insee for the publication of sectoral statistics. In the case of hairdressers, the code in the NAF is [96.02A](https://www.insee.fr/fr/metadonnees/nafr2/sousClasse/96.02A?champRecherche=false). From the open data available, it is possible, in a few lines of `Python`, to get the list of all hairdressers and then explore this data (the subject of the next optional exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following optional exercise suggests replicating, in a simplified manner, the survey done by [tif.hair/](https://tif.hair/) on puns in hair salon names. It allows practicing some text manipulation methods, ahead of the chapter dedicated to [regular expressions](../../content/manipulation/04b_regex_TP.qmd).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset of all companies is quite large (around 4GB in CSV after decompression), it is more practical to use a dataset in `Parquet` format, which is more optimized (more details on this format in the [advanced chapter](../../content/modern-ds/s3.qmd) dedicated to it).\n",
    "\n",
    "To read this type of file optimally, it is recommended to use the `DuckDB` library, which allows consuming only the necessary data instead of downloading the entire file to read only a part of it as would be the case with `Pandas` (see the end of this chapter, section “Beyond `Pandas`”). The following SQL query translates into natural language as: *“From the `Parquet` file, I only want a few columns of the file for hairdressers (APE: 96.02A) whose business name (`denominationUsuelleEtablissement`) is provided”*:"

    "For individuals, there exists a unique identifier that allows linking them across different data sources: the [NIR](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/definition/nir-numero-dinscription-au-repertoire), also known as the INSEE number or social security number.\n",
    "This number is necessary for the administration to manage social benefits (health, retirement, family…). Beyond this function, which can be useful daily, this number is a unique individual identifier in the [National Register of Physical Persons (RNIPP)](https://www.insee.fr/fr/metadonnees/definition/c1602).\n",

The goal of this anonymized identifier is to reduce the dissemination of personal information that, although allowing civil servants and researchers to deterministically link numerous databases, provided analysts with non-essential information about the individuals in question.\n",

    "There is a before and after `Pandas` in data analysis with `Python`. Without this incredibly practical package, Python, despite all its strengths, would have struggled to establish itself in the data analysis landscape. However, while `Pandas` offers a coherent syntax in many aspects, it is not perfect either. More recent data analysis paradigms in `Python` sometimes aim to correct these syntactical imperfections.\n",

    "Among the most annoying points in everyday use is the need to regularly perform `reset_index` when building descriptive statistics. Indeed, it can be dangerous to keep indices that are not well controlled because, if we are not careful during the merge phases, they can be misused by `Pandas` to join data, leading to surprises.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pandas` is extremely well-designed for restructuring data from long to wide format or vice versa. However, this is not the only way to restructure a dataset that we might want to implement. It often happens that we want to compare the value of an observation to that of a group to which it belongs. This is particularly useful in anomaly analysis, outlier detection, or fraud investigation. Natively, in `Pandas`, you need to build an aggregate statistic by group and then merge it back to the initial data using the group variable. This is somewhat tedious:"

    "These two chapters have explored in depth the richness of the `Pandas` ecosystem, which is indispensable in the data scientist’s toolbox. Despite all the limitations we have mentioned, and the alternative solutions we will present, `Pandas` remains the central package of the data ecosystem with `Python`. In the following chapters, we will see its native integration with the `Scikit` ecosystem for machine learning or the extension of `Pandas` to spatial data with `GeoPandas`.\n",

    "`Polars` is certainly the paradigm most inspired by `Pandas`, even in the choice of name. The first fundamental difference lies in the internal layers used. `Polars` relies on the `Rust` implementation of `Arrow`, whereas `Pandas` relies on `Numpy`, which results in performance loss. This allows `Polars` to be more efficient on large volumes of data, especially since many operations are parallelized and rely on lazy evaluation, a programming principle that optimizes queries for logical rather than defined execution order.\n",

    "Another strength of `Polars` is its more coherent syntax, benefiting from over fifteen years of `Pandas` existence and almost a decade of `dplyr` (the data manipulation package within the `R` tidyverse paradigm). To take the previous example, there is no longer a need to force the reference to the DataFrame; in an execution chain, all subsequent references will be made with respect to the initial DataFrame.\n",
