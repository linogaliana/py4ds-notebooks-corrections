    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter aims to very briefly introduce the principle of training models in a classification context. The goal is to illustrate the process using an algorithm with an intuitive principle. It seeks to demonstrate some of the concepts discussed in previous chapters, particularly those related to model training. Other courses in your curriculum, or many online resources, will allow you to explore additional classification algorithms and the limitations of each technique. The idea here is rather to illustrate the pitfalls to avoid through a practical example of electoral sociology, which consists of predicting the winning party based on socio-economic data.\n",

All examples are based on US county level presidential election results combined with sociodemographic variables.

    "## 1.2 Methodological approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Principle of decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous chapters, we adopt a machine learning approach when we want simple operational rules that are easy to implement for decision-making purposes. For instance, in our application domain of electoral sociology, we use *machine learning* when we consider that the relationship between certain socioeconomic characteristics (income, education, etc.) is complex to grasp and that an excessive level of sophistication, though permitted by theory, would only bring limited performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate the traditional approach using intuitive classification methods based on decision trees. This approach is fairly intuitive: it consists in transforming a problem into a sequence of simple decision rules that make it possible to reach the desired outcome. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "-   if income is greater than \\$15,000 per year\n",
    "-   and age is less than 40 years\n",
    "-   and the level of education is higher than the baccalaureate\n",
    "\n",
    "then, statistically, we are more likely to observe a Democratic vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure <a href=\"#fig-iris-classification-en\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 1.1</a> illustrates, graphically, how a decision tree is built as a sequence of binary choices. This is the principle of the CART algorithm (*classification and regression tree*), which consists in building trees by chaining binary choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure id=\"fig-iris-classification-en\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/iris.svg\" />\n",
    "<figcaption>Figure 1.1: Example of a decision tree on the classic iris dataset. Source: <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html\">scikit-learn documentation</a></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation, we see that a first perfect decision rule makes it possible to determine the *setosa* class. Afterwards, a sequence of decision rules makes it possible to discriminate statistically between the next two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Iterative procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "This final structure is the result of an iterative algorithm. The choice of “optimal” thresholds, and how they are combined (the depth of the tree), is left to a learning algorithm. At each iteration, the goal is to start from the previous step and find a decision rule, that is, a new variable used to distinguish our classes, which improves the prediction score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, this is done by means of impurity measures, that is, measures of node homogeneity (the groups produced by the decision criteria). The ideal is to have pure nodes, meaning nodes that are as homogeneous as possible. The most commonly used measures are the Gini index and Shannon entropy.\n",

    "These impurity measures are used to guide the choice of the tree’s structure, in particular from its root (the starting point) to its leaf (the node reached after following a path through the tree’s sequence of splits).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than starting from a blank page and testing rules until finding a few that work well, one generally starts from an overly large set of rules and progressively prunes it (*prune* in English). This makes it easier to limit overfitting, which consists in creating very specific rules that apply to a limited set of data and therefore have low extrapolation potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we return to Figure **?@fig-iris-classification-fr**, we can see that some nodes apply to a very small subset of the data (samples of three or four observations): the statistical power of these rules is probably limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Application\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply a classification model, we need to find a dichotomous variable. The natural choice is to use the dichotomous variable of a party’s victory or defeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the Republicans lost in 2020, they won in more counties (less populated ones). We will consider a Republican victory as our *label* 1 and a defeat as *0*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the following variables to create our decision rules."
